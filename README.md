# compare_rates

The project was to work on scraping data from websites.  But also to answer a question my friend (a mortgage lender) had, which was what the relationship between the mortgage lock rates compared to both inflation and the federal reserve prime interest rate.

In this project I scraped data from three different websites:
- one with historical Federal Reserve Prime Interest Rates
- historical average mortgage lock rates
- historical inflation data.
